## 📝 README: Daily Calorie Tracker CLI

### Project Title: Daily Calorie Tracker (CLI)

This project implements a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) tool written in Python to help users monitor and track their daily calorie intake. It allows logging individual meals, calculating totals, comparing consumption against a daily limit, and generating a neatly formatted session report.

### 🌟 Features

* [cite_start]**Meal Logging:** Allows the user to input the name and calorie count for multiple meals in a single session[cite: 11, 29, 30].
* [cite_start]**Data Management:** Stores meal names and corresponding calorie amounts using lists[cite: 15, 31].
* [cite_start]**Calculations:** Calculates the **total calorie intake** using `sum()` and the **average calories per meal** using arithmetic operators[cite: 35, 36, 37].
* [cite_start]**Limit Comparison:** Compares the total calorie intake against a user-defined daily limit and displays a warning if the limit is exceeded using `if...else` statements[cite: 38, 41, 42].
* [cite_start]**Formatted Output:** Prints a clean, easy-to-read summary table with totals and averages to the console using f-strings and escape characters[cite: 46, 54].
* [cite_start]**Session Persistence (Bonus):** Option to save the complete session log, including the comparison status and meal details, to a `.txt` file using basic file I/O[cite: 18, 57, 58].

### 🚀 Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.

#### Installation and Setup

1.  [cite_start]**Create the project folder** `daily_calorie_tracker/`[cite: 22].
2.  [cite_start]**Inside the folder, create the file** `tracker.py`[cite: 23].
3.  **Place the Python code** inside the `tracker.py` script.
4.  **Run the tracker script:**
    ```bash
    python tracker.py
    ```
